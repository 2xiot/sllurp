# LLRPyC

This repository began in August 2013 as a snapshot of the dormant
[LLRPyC project][]'s [code][] on SourceForge.  It has been somewhat updated to
work with Impinj Speedway readers (and probably still other readers).

[LLRPyC project]: http://wiki.enneenne.com/index.php/LLRPyC
[code]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/llrpyc/.

## Quick Start

1. Figure out your reader's IP address `ip.add.re.ss`
2. `./clients/simple_inventory/simple_inventory.py ip.add.re.ss`
