reader_test.py - test if an LLRP reader is compliant to the protocol

This script executes some tests on a remote reader to test if it's
LLRP protocol compliant.

Current implementation does the following tests:

  'Connection tests'
          simple_connection,
          double_connection,

To run the program use the command line:

 $ ./simple_inventory.py [<options>] host

where <options> are:
	-h - show this help message
	-d - enable debugging messages

and host is the internet address of the remote reader.
